# TheGame
I am trying to make a game using JavaScript, In this game, the user will be playing as a wbc(white blood cell), and will be collecting all the viruses and will get points if the user gets correct viruses, and will not get any points or the points will reduce if wrong viruses are collected.
<br>
Press the <b>"Space Bar"</b> Key or <b>Mouse Click button </b> or <b>Touch anywhere on screen </b>to jump and keep collecting the correct virus flu.
<br>
Go to <a href="https://vish01.github.io/TheGame/"> TheGame </a> to play this game!

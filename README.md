# TheGame
I am trying to make a game using JavaScript, In this game, the user will be playing as a wbc(white blood cell), and will be collecting all the viruses and will get points if the user gets correct viruses, and will not get any points or the points will reduce if wrong viruses are collected.
Run this project using Firefox or with a server if you want to test this game, because Google Chrome is having Cross-origin requests error which can only be accessed using a server.
